The golang language was used in the version go1.10.2 linux / amd64 for development.

It was observed in the problem that it would need a language that could handle a wide range of processing and use all the power of the machine, so the language chosen was Go.

To install the language you need to follow the instructions at the link: https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-go-on-debian-8
